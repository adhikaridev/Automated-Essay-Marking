Kantipur Engineering College (KEC), under the affiliation of Tribhuvan University, has been imparting engineering education since 1998 with the objective to produce qualified and proficient engineers capable of facing the engineering challenges of this modern era, where science and technology is dominating every fields of our life. At the time, engineering subjects were revolutionary—today, they’re more important than ever. In these years, we put enormous efforts and spent a lot of resources to pursue excellence in engineering education. At present, KEC is one of the largest and among the few colleges having its own physical infrastructure.
