Dear Newspaper, I strongly agree that computers have effected people in a very positive way. Since more and more people have been using computers, the technology gets higher and people can acess much more things. Computers are good because they are convinent, and provide entertainment. Have you ever wanted to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is, or what the weather is in @LOCATION2? To find out these answers, all you have to do is look them up on the computer! The computer is so convient, that whenever you have a question about anything, you can use the computer! Take my cousing courthey, for example, everyday, her teacher asigns definitions for homework. So, she just looks up the definitions on the computer instead of taking the time to find them in the dictionary. However, @PERSON4 isn't the only person who thinks the computer is convinent. When surveyed, @PERCENT1 of people voted that when they have a question about something the computer is the most convinent item to use. Professor @PERSON2, from @ORGANIZATION2 says, "@CAPS1, since more people are learning how to use the computer, it is becoming more convinent to everyone." In conclusion, many people rely on the computer for information, and you wouldn't want to take that away from them, would you? It's a @DATE1 @TIME1, and your bored, what do you do? How about go on the computer! The computer is a great source of entertainment. Whether its listening to music, playing games, or talking with friends, you will always have fun on the computer. For example, my neighbor, @PERSON3, comes home after school by herself. She is usually extremely bored, so, she goes on the computer and plays games, and talk with friends. @PERSON3 can also talk to her cousins, @PERSON5 and @PERSON6, that live in @LOCATION1. But, @PERSON3 is not the only one who talks to relatives on the internet. When surveyed, @PERCENT2 of people agreed that they talk to relatives from other places on the computer. Dr. @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says, "The computer is the main source of entertainment for most teens and adults." @CAPS2, you wouldn't want to take away our main source of enteratinment, would you? After school, many teens and adults go rushing to the computers for all different reasons. But, in conclusion, computers have positively affected all people with their amazing convinence, and great sources of entertainment. 6
