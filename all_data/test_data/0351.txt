Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people go outside and exercising because their are three reason why people should go outside and there are: people don't have a lot of exercising, they can hang out with their friend and family, and people and kid should enjoying the outsid nature. Let me explain, people and kids these days do have alot of exercising. People who don't exercising can gran weight if they don't exercising at all. Also, parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be over weight. Kids these day, have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by staying on their computer and play their computer game. Wouldn't you agree the kids and adults can hang out with there frienda and family. Kids need to stop going on the computer and go outside more offing with their friend or family. You might want to consider that parent need to spend time with there friend and family then staying on the computer at home. Don't you think that people should go outside and enjoying the nature. Amazingly, people know what nature is but the don't know what the true meaning of nature is! Adult should spend time by going outside then stayin at their house because @PERCENT1 of the world dont have computer at all. 4
