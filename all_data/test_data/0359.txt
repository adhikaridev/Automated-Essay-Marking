Do Computers @CAPS1 Society? This question might be answered forever. I have an opinion about this and it might not effect everyone in the world but I do hope so. Exercising, great way to stay in shape but is you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 all day you donâ€™t have a chance to stay in shape. So while everyone is fit you eventually will be fat. Whik you sit there playing the some @ORGANIZATION1 game everyon is out side playing at the park, swimming in the pool or fishing at the lake. Sitling on a @ORGANIZATION1 destroys your life bot physically and socially. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 will stop you from spending time with friends and family. Also this will stop you from interacting with new friend, and your old ones will find new ones. Lastly, I you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 you will miss out on the awesome @CAPS2 life you were waiting for since you can remember. So the next time your friend says to go online after school, say you'd rather not because you don't want to get addicted. 3
