Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Your resources, your entertainment, even your communication with people might be fading. @CAPS8 you know a large portion of people think this @PERSON2 is harming our society. Well I will say I think they don't understand these benifit that computers bring us. Computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination is a perfect example. Plus, we use computers to learn about places we might want to travel to, or have a conversation with frinds or family living ways away tromus. Computers is an extrodarny piece or technology. First, I like to say everything that you do physically uses hand-eye coordination. Making dinner, riding a bike, driving a car etc. And unfortiunitly not @CAPS6 people are the best at hand-eye coordination. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had horriable hand eye coordination. So for his birthday I decided an getting him a computer. It's been @NUM1 month since his he had his computer and @CAPS8 he was trying to hit a baseball at his sons party, he moneged to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3 where he used to hit it @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6. @PERCENT2 is a termendous increase in only @NUM1 month! Just something @CAPS8 simple @CAPS8 a computer improved @CAPS7 friends hand-eye coordination a termendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far away places @CAPS8 the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you really want to travel up to the icey cold, and piercing winds of the @LOCATION1 just to learn about it? For some I'd say like that but what if you cant travel up the @LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions. I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry. A statics from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states "@PERCENT2 of people wpould love to experience the thrill and excitement of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. But out of those @PERCENT2 only @PERCENT3 said they'd actually travel to @LOCATION2 to see them". So you can see that @PERCENT4 of those people wouldn't go whether it be due to money or the cold. Thery @CAPS6 said thats why they love the computer. They can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold.Lastly, that better thing to do on the computer than with family you've never met before or don't get to see them. The editor for the @LOCATION3 Local states "@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarly get to tell to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance ofter. So I use @CAPS7 computer, @CAPS7 parents and I now communicate @PERCENT1 more than we used to. I love the computer it helps keep me close to @CAPS7 loved ones." @CAPS8 you can tell, thanks to the computer we talk @PERCENT1 more to his parents than he used to! In conclusion, the computer is a gracous device that is extremely benifital to people. The computer teaches us hand-eye coordination, lets us learn about places we other wise would never learn about, and to have conversations with friends or family that we generally dont get to see often. Now you go out and make anyone that says computers are a horrible inventions you tell them exactly why computers are so important! 6
