Dear @CAPS1 paper, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I am writing this letter on the count of the computer issue. @CAPS2 look on this subject is the oppisite. People @MONTH1 spend more time on the computer then exercising, but theycould still be social in chat rooms. People can use laptops out doors. You can spread your imagination with the games you can play. Lets get onto @CAPS2 first point, being social. The experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer. They @MONTH1 be spending less time with there friend and family physicly, but who said there not being social. Theres facebook, @CAPS3, and chat rooms. You can talk to your friend on there so they on being social. Not being physicly social but verbily social. On to @CAPS2 next subject the expert say were not enjoying out doors, but the over looked something here it is. If were not enjoying outdoors then half of amarica would be as plae as can be. Then theres laptops. You can use thoughs out doors. People that have laptops can go outside on a sunny day grab some fruit and relax. You could stay out there till the batterie deis. Then just grab the pluge and keep relaxing its easy. Computers also help your imagination. Some computer games help expand your imagination because when your playing games you think of things that could make the game better. Simulaters help you design or even controll things. Some games allow you design and play as a character you created. They help you jobs that you might be intrested in. For me computer games expanded @CAPS2 drawing. All these thing can be reversed. No one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again. Humanity has the power to get off the computer, and go outside or be social. As I just proved everything you can physicly you can do on the computer. 4
