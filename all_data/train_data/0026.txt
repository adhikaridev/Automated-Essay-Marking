Do you think that computers are useless? Or do you think they could be useful in many ways? I remember my older sister had to do some research on the computer gave her all of the information she needed. The issue to grapple with is, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly think that does benifit society in many ways! Heres why, the computer allows you to get in touch with friends, research people, places or things, and relax and enjoy playing on a fun, entertaining website! My first reason is that allows you to talk to family or friends so you all get back in touch if a friend of yours moved to a diffrent state, then you can easily get back in touch straight from the computer. "'s nice to send emails or pictures to friends, but if you do from the computer then gets done so much faster!" @PERSON1, one of my neighbors. My next reason is that you can research anything you want like people, places or things and all refferances will come up. is good to research for any projects, or school assignments you @MONTH1 have. I remember my brother was working on his project. Everything he had trouble with, he found directly on the computer! My final reason is that there are alot of fun and exciting websites that you can relax and play on! These websites can keep you busy, and you wont be bored while playing! " im bored I go on the computer and play games, that I find on .com," my younger cousin, @PERSON2. Computers @MONTH1 make people become adicted to them. Yes but, you will be learning some interesting things on how the internet works. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly beleive that they do benefit society, heres why you can get in touch with people, you can research, and play fun games! 's now or never to decide what you think! Call me and we will talk this through. 5
