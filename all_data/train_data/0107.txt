Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to today's society. Not only do computers help us connect with peopl, but think of how efficiant they can be. And you can't neglect the fact that computers offer a profusion of entertainment. So before you say, "Computers are ruining our society.", please read my reasons why computers are essential. What is the first thing that comes to mind when I you hear 'computers'. Many people think of the chatrooms and @CAPS2's. Those are two examples of how a computer can bring people together. Imagine you doing a report on life in @LOCATION1. However, all you can find are those generic articles in old books. A simple solution is talking online to an actual person who lives in @LOCATION1. Computers can even help connect family members who live long distances from each other. I know that i would be overflowing with bliss if an aunt or uncle contacted me through '@CAPS3' or e-mail. In addition to connecting with people, computers are very efficiant. As students mature, homework is taken seriously. For instance, one of my friends handed in an essay and our teacher did not accept it. Her penmenship was not legible. Typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy, unsophisticated work. The efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks. Just imagine how often you'd get lost without your directions from. Or how much you'd mess up if you didn't print out a recipe for dinner. Most importantly, computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment. Whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is you game; a computer will suit you. There are. Thousand of website to visit and even more games just waiting to be played. A computer is anyone's passport to leisure and enjoyments. So you make the choice. Is a computer going to benefit society, or will they have catastrophic results. I urge you to remember; computer are a way to connect with people and they are efficiant. Most of all, remember how much you can achieve with a computer. 5
