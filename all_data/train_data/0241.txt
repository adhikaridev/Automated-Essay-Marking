Dear @CAPS1, This a letter telling you my opinion about computer. Yes people do spend that time in computers a lot, its because computers are very helpful in many ways. Computers help us with our job, school, work ect. For example science. Im in @NUM1 grade. My teacher @PERSON1 gives us homework; every @DATE1, we have to do @ORGANIZATION1 are @NUM2 facts about anything you want to write about. A lot of people look up bears on @ORGANIZATION2 and they do their assigment about bears. Jobs; secreatenes always have to use computer for everything in our school secreaterys and teachers use computers for attendance, grading. They check you, attendance, grade, phone number and schedule. Communication, my dad the computer wuth our family from @LOCATION1. We talk to know how they've been, to know whats new. Like a week ago I was chating to my cousin she told me her dog had @NUM3 puppies. My family also uses the computer, to order. My uncle went to ticketmaster.com and he ordered two tickets for wwe. He also orders his flight tickets in his computer, to go to @LOCATION1. Well my point is people use computer a lot because they are, very helpful in many ways. Its not good to just be in the computer it good to outside enjoy nature live your life exercise not only to be in shape, but for your health. @CAPS1 hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers. Thank you for taking your time and reading I really appreciate it. 4
