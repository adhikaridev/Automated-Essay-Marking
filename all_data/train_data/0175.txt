Coumputors are mind browning on what they can do. They can make or break somone financhely. They also can perduce amasing graphis that aritist cant perduce. Coumputrs are also for great for recer antal acitivitys, and they also take your life away. I not talking about a real life @CAPS1 talking about the activitys you do away from home. Now lets see the benifits and problems we come so far on how we handle money. We use to put it in chets and hide them now all we do is click and type in a securty number. people can also invist in items but invisting is tricky you dont always win.

The lights in the back pixels do most of the wort to bring stunning graphis to life. On coumputers today people make money by selling graphis they made on coumputers. So this would be another plus on what a coumputor dose to a human. I went to a school to lern how to perduce great graphis. All teens kids and adults have used a coumputer for recerantol acivitys. On todays coumputors you can play games watch videos, and listen on coumputors. People do this to engoy then selfs. Some people ran get in trouble for fooling around on the web. But there is nothing stressed out and just playing some games for a while, personly I like to go on youtube and find funny vidos after school. I use to own a youtube account and get many views. The worst thing about coumpurts is it can ruin plan gobo or somones socal life some people get addicted and cant stop being on the coumputor until it is takin away. For example some people play world of war craft get addicted and cant stop! I had a problem when I had to chek you tube a lot. Well I hoped you readers. No matter what happens I think coumputors bennafit more than the problems 4
