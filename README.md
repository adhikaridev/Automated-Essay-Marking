# Automated-Essay-Marking

Good writing skills are essential in the education system at all levels. However,
the evaluation of essays is labor intensive and can entail a subjective bias.
Automated Essay Marking (AEM) is a tool that may be able to save teacher time
and provide more objective evaluations. There are several successful AEM
systems for essays in English that are used in large scale tests. Supervised
machine learning algorithms are the core component in developing these systems.
The project aims to build an automated essay marking system using a data set of
essays collected on-line. We extract features such as total word count per essay,
sentence count, number of long words, part of speech counts etc, from the training
set essays. We use a linear regression model to learn from these features and
generate parameters for testing and validation. Then we assign score to the given
essay. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science,
Artificial Intelligence and Computational linguistics concerned with the
interactions between computers and human(natural) languages, and, in particular,
concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural
language corpora. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve
natural language understanding, natural language generation(frequently from
formal, machine-readable logical forms), connecting language and machine
perception, dialog systems , or some combination therefore.
