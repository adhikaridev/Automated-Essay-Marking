Dear, whom @MONTH1 concern; Local Newspaper. I belive you are right. Computers can be helpful, let us chat with people but we donâ€™t exercise. Forget about family and most importantly yor health their vision gets bad, they eat more junk foor and that can lead to bad cholersterol. High blood pressure and even diabities. A computer is very addicting people stay up on it for hours. It will give you bad higiens so I think you should really take a look at this and put this on the Newspaper and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 residents I know it could be very fun and ejoyable but it would be all fun and games until your very sick you @MONTH1 take this as but this is highly serious in many ways. Not being with the people you love not doing any activities you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life for. A computer is like a drug but do it for your family and listen to my point of view so I think all computers should be banned for at least one week to look up on work or school and maybe even your health. This @MONTH1 seem like were overacting on this but we really arent. Do you want population on people having diabetis and other causing affects that can happen to your body increase. Well I think not how would that make you feel. Not good al all so people get of your feet and jogg. Do whateverenjoy time with your family. So just listen to me and stop this badd habbit. 4
