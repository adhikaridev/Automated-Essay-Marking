Dear @ORGANIZATION3, In a pole conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people agreed that computers are a easier way to research than going to a library. Over the @DATE1 few years it has become a growing debate as to wheather computers are a benifit to socity or not. Today in america over @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer, according to the @ORGANIZATION1 are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary. Communication is a vital part @ORGANIZATION1 america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. @CAPS3 computers provide better and faster communication. They are also far more reliable. In the @DATE2's if you wanted to speech with some one who is far away you would have to send a letter. Along with sending a letter is the risks that it will not get there. it will be stolen in the mail and @ORGANIZATION1 course the time that it would take to ge there. All @CAPS3 are solved in todays email and instant messiging (@CAPS2), @CAPS3 are relible, cant be stolen, and can go across the globe in seconds. Computers are not only a way for communication but also one @ORGANIZATION1 the most prominate ways to research, @CAPS4 the internet people would need to go to the library and run the risk @ORGANIZATION1 the book not being there or the library being closed. Through the internet all the information @ORGANIZATION1 the world is available @NUM1./ Computers are also the former in todays technological advances. Computers allow us to have inventions that run there self so human operation is not nessisary. this same technology saves lives every day and alows us to create @ORGANIZATION3 better technology. As you can see computers are the greatest technology created in the @DATE1 and allows faster and more relible communication, is the greatest library the world has ever known, and allows for the creation @ORGANIZATION1 even more advanced technologies. Computers are an extreme benifit to socity and nessisary in this @ORGANIZATION3 era. 5
