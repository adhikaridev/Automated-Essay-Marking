Dear people from the newspaper, I am concerned that people take too much time on the computer because it could cause trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes. First, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses trouble, in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people in the @LOCATION1, do bad stuff like starting rumors, & saying bad stuff about people they dispise, in the @DATE1, @PERCENT2 @DATE1 teens form ages @NUM1 were envolven with the rumor spreading. This would be bad for all children. All these reasons will lead to the @NUM2 below. Secondly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses voilence, because @DATE1 the reasons started in the @NUM3 paragraph, if all this continues, then it @MONTH1 & lead to voilence, in @DATE1 @NUM4 people died from all the crimes online. @NUM5 threats were found online from big websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2 & @CAPS3. Lastly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it could lead to illegal crimes, In @DATE3 a girl was talking to a boy online then when they decided to meet, he shot & killed her. It turned out he was just a person who lied about who he was online, @CAPS4 on a website online, a group @DATE1 men were talking about now much they hated kids so they decided to shot them @ their bus stops. Thank god that the police caught them before they were to do the crime In conclusion, I am concenred that people are spending too much time on the computer because it causes trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes. This @CAPS5 like totally needs to stop before everyone is addicted to spreading rumors. Thank you for your time in reading this letter. 4
