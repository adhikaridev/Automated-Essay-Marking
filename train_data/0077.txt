Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, "@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people threw the internet." @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than @NUM3 miles away from you? If you do, @CAPS2 a computer will solve your problem of communication. @CAPS1 friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, "I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in @CAPS1 essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with @CAPS1 family." I didn't want to tell you this, but i was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and i learned just like @LOCATION2 learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated. 4
