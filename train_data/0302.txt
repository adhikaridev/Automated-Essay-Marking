Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 is all about Computers. They can do anything. But think are they really helping us? Yes, they do research and all of that but physically they're not. You spend less time exercising, interacting with family and friend, and the impact that computers can do to @CAPS1 lives in the future. Exercise is necessary in @CAPS1 lives. "People need to get out there and do something other than be in front of the computer screen". says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. fact is one hour of exercise is good for your health. However, two in three @CAPS4 wont do so. Thats why @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on is the way we are @CAPS3 I lazy, unactive worthless and overweight. As a result, computers are the blame. Are there some relatives you been face to face with @CAPS5 its because of computers. Computers @CAPS3 let us things like video chat with relatives for or go on facebook and myspace or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to chat with them or email. The problem with this is being lazy. You could be out there getting to were your relatives live to see them. but why waste enemy going to travel agency when in the internet instead say travel agent @PERSON2. @NUM1 in @NUM2 people havent seen there relatives for other states in years. People need to go computers @CAPS7 games, @CAPS8 hows all on the computer at the You dont even have to take This is bad, People need do @CAPS11 the old fashoned way. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 @CAPS4 use the computer daily. People lose jobs over computers. Everything is made so simple, theres no need to hire secretary, as employ and more office personals. Factories, They dont need many people. Computerized @CAPS10 can take over jobs quicker, easier, and cheaper. They will one day take over. Thats not good. In conclusion, Computers @MONTH1 seemed like the best thing that hit earth, but if you really, really think about @CAPS11, @CAPS11's not. @CAPS11 prevents you from exercising, seeing friends and family, and cam impact @CAPS1 lives in a bad way. I hope you see where I'm coming from. 5
