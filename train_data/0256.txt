Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a great advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with @NUM1 reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even let you do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them. Most of them are free to create an account so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for them. So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting. Computers even have webcams for video chat. With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time, thats amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research. If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask.com. You can easily find the details and information you need. All this takes is just a couple minutes, which is alot better than reading for an hour or time. Lastly, if you really want something or need it just shop online. For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but its not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet. They even ship your item fast. I like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday. In conclusion, computers are very handy. If you need information, talk to someone, or buy something its got it. I use computers a lot. I think they are very great to have. 4
