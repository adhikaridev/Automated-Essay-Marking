Dear @LOCATION1, I think that computers have a negative affect on us! How many people have acess to a camputer daily in america..  and how many people go on at least an hour a half. That means that people cant exercise are wasting many are have the posibility of physical that sound good to you? Think of everything you done when you write a letter. I got up and got all the materials and sit back down. After In done writing have to put all the materials away and then put the letter in the mailbox and walk all the way back. Well this is what I had to do. Now think how you write an email sitdown and move your fingers. Do you see the difference? instead of getting a good walk to your friends house to talk to you just in him/er. Did you know that you can literally but from on your computer. Instead of around with this that can add anything you your computer gives away information they information lead to that and then everthing you have wouldbe gone. All this so you can go online. Believe it or not, you can phisically get hurt for being on the computer, to long. thing is that when you at a computerf what happened to my grandpa is that when you are in a wood chair all day you can get ardthritis in your muscle thing th. 4
